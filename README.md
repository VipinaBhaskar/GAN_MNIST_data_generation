# GAN_MNIST_data_generation
An Adversarial Generative Network (GAN) consists of two primary parts:

Generator: This part generates artificial intelligence data. It converts random noise that is supplied as input into data that is similar to the training dataset.
Discriminator: The discriminator's job is to tell created data from genuine data. It gains the ability to identify bogus and authentic data.
GANs use a feedback loop to function. As the discriminator gains experience in differentiating between authentic and fraudulent data, the generator strives to generate data that deceives the discriminator. The competition produces top-notch artificial intelligence content.
